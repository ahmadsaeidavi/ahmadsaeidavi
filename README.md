I am currently a master's student in Renewable Energy Engineering.
My main interests can be summarized as focused on increasing energy efficiency and sustainable development-related energy, thermal comfort, and renewable energy integration.
I aim to increase my understanding and knowledge in building energy, thermal modeling, computational fluid dynamics and applied thermodynamic methods. 
In modeling in various levels of details, measurement, and validation methods, decision-making is based on simulation.
